# SMAP_CDF_NJ -- Predictive Model
An app to display the CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) of soil moisture values at a given location in NJ created with Google Earth Engine JavaScript API. In addition it will predict whether there is going to be a flash drought event at the chosen location in NJ by the user. The application takes the most recent soil moisture values and compares it to the historical soil moisture data through a CDF function and then makes the prediction based on the percentile of the most recent soil moisture data value. The application also automatically updates the data. Therefore, when there is a new soil moisture data value available the application automatically classifies it as the most recent data value and adds the previous most recent data value to the historical dataset.
